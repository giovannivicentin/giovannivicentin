## About Me:
#### 👩‍💻 Full Stack Developer with a passion for continuous learning and professional growth. With a foundational education in Computer Science and a year's hands-on experience, I've honed my skills in TypeScript, React.js, NestJS, Python RPAs, and beyond.
#### 🥋 Outside of coding, I'm a dedicated karate enthusiast. Music fuels my soul, especially Brazilian rap. I frequently immerse myself in books, finding wisdom and inspiration in their pages.
#### 🚀 I'm deeply committed to self-evolution, always pushing myself to grow, both personally and professionally.
#### 🔗 Let's connect! Whether you'd like to collaborate, discuss the latest tech, share a book recommendation, or even swap some music suggestions, I'm here for it.
